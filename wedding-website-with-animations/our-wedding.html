  <p>Hola!</p>
  <p>We’re so excited to officially invite you to our wedding in beautiful Mexico City.</p>
  <p>This place holds a special meaning for us — some of our favorite memories together (and separately) have been while exploring new cities, soaking in culture, sharing one more round, and losing track of time. Mexico City is vibrant, creative, warm, and unforgettable — just like we hope this celebration will be.</p>
  <p>While the wedding marks the beginning of our next chapter, it’s also a moment to celebrate the friends, family, and loved ones who shaped us. If you’re reading this, it means you’ve had a lasting impact on our lives — and we’d be honored to celebrate with you.</p>
  <p>We know it’s no small thing to travel for a wedding. That’s why we’re doing everything we can to make the planning as smooth, the details as helpful, and the experience as fun and stress-free as possible.</p>
  <p>We also know that a destination wedding might not be feasible for everyone — and that's absolutely okay. Whether you're with us in person or in spirit, we’re so grateful to have you in our lives.</p>
  <p>Gracias for considering being part of it. We can't wait to toast, dance, and make memories with you in CDMX.</p>
  <p style="margin-top: 40px; font-style: italic;">Con amor,</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Aryn & Austin</p>
